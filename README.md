# Link Builder Class

** Work in progress. There will be gaps. Full documentation coming soon. **

Takes video ID's provided via text file (soon to be others) and constructs complete links based on site. For example, you can build lists of YouTube videos using only the unique ID's.

After instantiating the class, you can display a sample table output using:
	$OBJECT_NAME->display_links();
